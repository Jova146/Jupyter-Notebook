# **Objectives:**
# * List popular languages for Data Science
# * List common libraries for Data Science
# * Show basic arithmetic expressions

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
#    1. Python
#    2. R
#    3. Julia
#    4. Ruby

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
#    1. Pandas
#    2. Seaborn
#    3. Matplotlib

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[5]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[11]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
